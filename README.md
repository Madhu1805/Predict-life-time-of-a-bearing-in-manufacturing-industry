project- Predict life time of a bearing in manufacturing industry

Data Structure
Three (3) data sets are included in the data packet (IMS-Rexnord Bearing Data.zip). Each data set
describes a test-to-failure experiment. Each data set consists of individual files that are 1-second
vibration signal snapshots recorded at specific intervals. Each file consists of 20,480 points with the
sampling rate set at 20 kHz. The file name indicates when the data was collected. Each record (row) in
the data file is a data point. Data collection was facilitated by NI DAQ Card 6062E. Larger intervals of
time stamps (showed in file names) indicate resumption of the experiment in the next working day.
